<center><p>Hye everyone! My names is Nor Shaza Shafikah BT Zulkifli and i am 21 years old. I have three siblings and i am the youngest one.I have one beautiful sister and one handsome boy brother. I am kelantanese and i comes from felda chiku 03 gua musang kelantan. Here i am going to draw your attention about myself. First of all i am glad to tell you guys that i am a student of uitm kelantan and this is one of my project for my courses. Before i studying at UITM i was a form 6 student at SMK bandar chiku in Gua Musang. After all the effort and struggling that i have show now i can step up for another level to achive my dreams. The goals that i have set in my mind when i am in my early teen. I want to show and prove to my parents that i can make them proud of me eventhought back then im always playing. This is a little bit about my background that i can share with you guys.  </p></center> 

<center><p>lets dig more about me. For your information i am a little girl who are attracted to korean boy group that has been called BTS. They have seven member of the groups and was being lead by kim namjon( leader of BTS). Their song was attractive and they have a good looking visual, and of course their song was great. I have been follow them for almost 7 years since their first debut in 2013. The reason why i really-really love them because they give a lesson where i can learn to love myself better more and never give up in my life. All of their song have a meaning and lesson that i can related with my life. Ya of course i love them but i am still know my place.This is just a vitamin for me when i am struggling with my life.For example, When i am studying i always listen to their song, its makes me chillin and great. The most important is i was learn how to be myself and love myself. That was very important for sure. Hearing their song and seeing their variety show is a one ways i want to release my tension and forget about the problems. I know these is a weirdo hobbies ever but i dont care because this is me and this is about myself.   </center>
